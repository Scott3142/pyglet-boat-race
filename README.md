# Pyglet Boat Race

This code uses the `pyglet` library in Python to create a simple graphical game. The repository builds the game in four stages, adding functionality each time.

## Installation

You will need to install the `pyglet` Python library via `pip install pyglet` on your machine or in your IDE. Past that, all you need is a way of running Python code. This could be via a [local development environment](https://scott3142.uk/python-programming/codelabs/local-development-environment/) or via some browser-based software such as [Repl.it](https://repl.it/).

## Execution

The game can be played by executing the command `python src/<file-name>.py`.
